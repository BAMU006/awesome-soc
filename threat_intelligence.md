# Generic workflow

Here is [an example](https://www.erdalozkaya.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/) of what we could expect to have:

# Platform
## TIP choice: 
  * My recommendations for community ones: [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [OpenCTI](https://www.filigran.io/en/products/opencti/);
  * My recommendations for paid ones: [Sekoia.io](https://www.sekoia.io/fr/produire-et-personnaliser-votre-propre-intelligence/), [ThreatQuotient](https://www.threatq.com/)

## Common TIP integrations (dataflow)

As per [Forrester article](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/15-11-07-starting_soon_threat_intelligence_platforms_research_0/), here are examples of common integration between threat intel sources, TIP, and security solutions:

## Architecture example:

Here is [an example](https://securityonline.info/s1em-siem-with-sirp-and-threat-intel/) of an architecture with:
 * SIEM: Elastic;
 * TIP: MISP, OpenCTI;
 * SSIRP TheHive;
 * Threat intel orchestrator: Cortex;

# Threat intelligence and automation

## Threat intel program and automation

As per [ThreatConnect artcile](https://threatconnect.com/blog/tip-soar-creating-increased-capability-for-less-mature-teams/):
> As threat intelligence drives your orchestrated actions, the result of those actions can be used to create or enhance existing threat intelligence. Thus, a feedback loop is created â€” threat intelligence drives orchestration, orchestration enhances threat intelligence.

## Identity-based detections:
 
* Correlate identity-related detections (from sensors like EDR, CASB, proxies, WAF, AD, ...) with identity intelligence (for instance, passwords leak/sell detection); 
  * Here is an example of the global detection process (with courtesy of RecordedFuture):
