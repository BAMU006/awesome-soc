# Awesome SOC
A collection of sources of documentations, and field best practices to build/run a SOC.

Those are my view, based on my own experience as SOC/CERT analyst and team manager, as well as well-known papers. 

NB: Generally speaking, SOC here refers to detection activity, and CERT/CSIRT to incident response.

# Critical means (tools/sensors):

## Critical tools for a SOC/CERT:
* SIEM (see: https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem)
   * see Gartner magic quadrant: https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/2021-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-security-information-event-w-8758 
   * e.g.: Splunk, Elastic...
* SIRP (see: https://d3security.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-soar-and-sao/)
  * e.g.: TheHive, PAN XSOAR, IBM Resilient, SwimLane...
* SOA (see: https://d3security.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-soar-and-sao/)
  * e.g.: TheHive, PAN XSOAR, IBM Resilient, SwimLane...
* TIP (see: https://d3security.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-soar-and-sao/)
  * e.g.: MISP, OpenCTI, ThreatQuotient...

## Critical sensors for a SOC:

* **Antimalware**
  * See Gartner magic quadrant: https://www.threatscape.com/microsoft-security-named-leader-in-4-gartner-magic-quadrants/ 
* **Endpoint Detection and Response** (see: https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-detection-and-response-solutions)
  * see Gartner magic quadrant: https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/securityprod/2022/01/Gartner-EIA-1963x2048.png 
* **Security Email Gateway** (see: https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/email-security)
* **Security Weg Gateway** / Security Service Edge (see: https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/secure-web-gateway)
  * see Gartner magic quadrant: https://www.zscaler.fr/cdn-cgi/image/format%3Dauto/sites/default/files/images/page/gartner-magic-quadrant-security-service-edge-sse-2022/zscaler-gartner-sse-2022-%401x.png 
* **AD security** (audit logs, or security monitoring)
  * e.g.: Semperis
* Cloud Access Security Broker, if company's IT environment uses a lot of external services like SaaS/IaaS (see: https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/cloud-access-security-brokers-casbs)

## Critical tools for CERT:
* On-demand sandbox
* Forensics and reverse-engineering tools suite
  * e.g.: SIFT Workstation: https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation/, Tsurugi: https://tsurugi-linux.org/
* Incident tracker, FireEye Flare-VM: https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm 
  * e.g.: Timesketch: https://timesketch.org/
